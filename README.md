# Regrowable Leaves
Minecraft Mod that slowly regrows leaves on trees.

See https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/regrowable-leaves

Leaves will slowly regrow over time when they are broken by a player.

Leaves will only regrow if they are lit up "just like a tree growing from a sapling."

They will not regrow if a tree has been cut down and leaves decay normally.

*Now Supports Biome's O Plenty and Vanilla Leaves!*

They will not regrow when the tree is cut down only if a player breaks the actual leaf blocks. Leaf decay still works as normal and regrown leaves will always check to make sure they can be sustained "Attached to a tree" or else the new leaves will decay.

This works by placing an invisible block in the place of the original leaf block. If any other block is placed over this the leaf will not regrow.

There is Config options to change the regrowth rate and light requirement.
